      <div class="post-content">
        <p>Upon reflection, yesterday, I realised it's been a little over three years i moved out of Nigeria.
          I've lived in four small cities in Germany since then. Presently, I am living in <strong><a href="http://www.budapest.com" target="_blank">Budapest</a></strong>, I have been here for three months now and I am loving every minute.</p>
          <p>If someone had told me that I would have the level of <em>intercultural awareness</em> I have right now, I would not have believed them. Most people grow up with stereotypes of other people ibued in their head, whether you believe it or not is another matter. Just a few days ago, I asked my friends here to tell me some of the craziest stereotypes that people have of Hungarians and I decided to share it with you.</p>
          <p>You can either read about it here or watch the video on youtube! Let me know what you think and if you have ideas for other blog topics, be sure to leave comments below. Thank you and Szia!</p>
